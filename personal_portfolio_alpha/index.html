        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I am Raj and I am so glad that you had dropped by my page!</p>

        <p>
          Currently, I am taking my baby steps into the working world - trying
          to gain insights into the technological. Over the past summer, I was a
          Data Analyst Intern at Smartkarma. My role here had allowed me to fine
          tune my programming skills, learn various aspects of business
          intelligence and an exposure to the greater financial world. The
          summer had also seen the completion of my flagship project, BASA, a
          blockchain-based platform connecting tenants to landlords. I invite
          you to explore this platform as it moves into the alpha stage (link in
          projects).
        </p>

        <p>
          I am an alumnus of Victoria Junior College and Victoria School.
          Formerly, I had studied in the prestigious Victoria-Cedar Integrated
          Program, which fast-tracked me through the GCE O-Levels and allowed me
          to sit for the GCE A-Levels directly. I had graduated my high school
          in 2020, receiving full distinction (90/90 RP) for my GCE A-Levels. I
          was fortunate to have been given the opportunity to study beyond the
          normal curricula during my time in high school. For one, I had studied
          Advanced Chemistry (H3 Chemistry), a level higher than the majority of
          my peers for my A-Levels. My academic portfolio spans various national
          academic competitions that required intense preparation, including the
          2019 Singapore Physics Olympiad, 2019 American Mathematics Competition
          and the 2020 MAS-ESS Economics Essay Competition.

          This autumn, I will be matriculating into the undergraduate Computer
          Science Program in National University Singapore. I really do look
          forward to my time there, hoping to expand my intellectual capacity
          and to create wonderful memories with my peers and professors.
        </p>

          Oh yes, a bit about myself. I love to program various everyday tasks
          in order to automate the mundane. I also believe in the importance of
          continual self improvement. I have a sort of 'Ok Raj' (OKR) to
          evaluate myself over the past 4 months as well as to navigate further
          improvements over the next 4 months. As they say; routine is the
          enemy!

        <h3>Smartkarma</h3>
        <p>
          Over the past summer I had the opportunity to work at a Fintech
          company that specialises in connecting research providers to
          institutions. Indeed, my first work expereince had been truly amazing.
          Despite coming in with a foundational background in Python, the
          internship had allowed me to gain practical coding knowledge on the
          job, learn new skills namely SQL to pull data and Excel to visulaise
          data and, a high level understanding of the financial markets. In
          fact, directly emailing the CEO of the company was the best decision
          that I had stepped on and I am extremely glad to have earned the trust
          of my peers to manage projects with real consequences.
